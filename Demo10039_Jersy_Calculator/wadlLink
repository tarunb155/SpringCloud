Jersey contains support for Web Application Description Language (WADL). 
WADL is a XML description of a deployed RESTful web application. 
It contains model of the deployed resources, their structure, supported media types, HTTP methods and so on. 
In a sense, WADL is a similar to the WSDL (Web Service Description Language) which describes SOAP web services. 
WADL is however specifically designed to describe RESTful Web resources.
