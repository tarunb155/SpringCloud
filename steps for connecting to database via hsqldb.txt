1) Delete the already present server.properties file from Hsql folder to start the fresh database with below settings in server.properties(reference is tutorial point of HSQLDB)

server.database.0 = file:hsqldb/demodb
server.dbname.0 = testdb

2) Run these two steps separately by doing cmd on hsqldb path
java -classpath lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server
java -classpath lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 file:hsql/demodb --dbname.0 testdb

3) Now you can run the bat file runManagerSwing.bat present inside the bin folder. It will open the ui page then there give the setting name as HSQLDatabase Engine and url as jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/testdb

4)Then create the table you want either manually or by using java jdbc code as below 

/*C1*/SET SCHEMA SYSTEM_LOBS
INSERT INTO BLOCKS VALUES(0,2147483647,0)
COMMIT
/*C2*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
CREATE TABLE STUDENT(ROLL_NO INT NOT NULL, STUDENT_NAME VARCHAR(80), STUDENT_ADDRESS VARCHAR(80))
/*C3*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(1,'aanchal','Lucknow')
COMMIT
DISCONNECT
/*C4*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(2,'Barbie','Delhi')
COMMIT
DISCONNECT
/*C5*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(3,'Sachin','Mumbai')
COMMIT
DISCONNECT
/*C6*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
DELETE FROM STUDENT WHERE ROLL_NO=1 AND STUDENT_NAME='aanchal' AND STUDENT_ADDRESS='Lucknow'
COMMIT

COMMIT
DISCONNECT
/*C10*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(2,'Akshay','Kolkata')
COMMIT
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(3,'Almer','Mumbai')
COMMIT
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(4,'Ashwin','Chennai')
COMMIT
DISCONNECT
/*C11*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
DISCONNECT
/*C12*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
DISCONNECT
/*C13*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
DISCONNECT
/*C2*/DISCONNECT
